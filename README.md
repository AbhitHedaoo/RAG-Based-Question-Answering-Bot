# RAG-Based-Question-Answering-Bot

A streamlined AI-powered document question-answering application designed to retrieve information from PDF documents with contextual relevance and accuracy, utilizing LangChain and FAISS for efficient document retrieval and processing.

**What is RAG**: RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, is a technique that combines the capabilities of a pre-trained large language model with an external data source. This approach combines the generative power of LLMs like GPT-3 or GPT-4 with the precision of specialized data search mechanisms, resulting in a system that can offer nuanced responses.

**Project Description**: Document Q&A Bot is an intelligent system that processes PDF documents, enabling users to ask questions and receive responses derived directly from the document's content. It combines advanced language processing using LangChainâ€™s document retrieval and embeddings capabilities, leveraging Google Generative AI and FAISS for high-speed vectorized document search. This project is designed for those seeking a scalable and accurate solution for document-based question answering.

**Key Features**:
- **Contextual Q&A**: Provides responses based on the exact context within the document.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Uses FAISS for quick retrieval of relevant document chunks.
- **Dynamic Embedding and Chaining**: Integrates embeddings from Google Generative AI and Groq language models to enhance document understanding.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Easily adaptable for different document collections and contexts.
  
**Technology Stack**:
- **LangChain**: For seamless chaining and retrieval processes.
- **FAISS**: Optimized for efficient vector similarity searches.
- **Google Generative AI Embeddings**: For creating high-quality embeddings of document contents.
- **Streamlit**: Provides an interactive UI for user questions and document embedding.

**Challenges & Future Improvements**:
- **Fine-tuning Retrieval**: Improving answer accuracy by adjusting embeddings and vector search.
- **UI/UX Enhancement**: Adding more user-friendly components and customization options.
- **Additional Document Formats**: Expanding beyond PDF to include other document types.
  
**Installation**:

**Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install necessary libraries: pip install langchain langchain-google-genai langchain-community faiss-cpu PyPDF2 pypdf dotenv

**Set Up API Keys**: Ensure your GROQ_API_KEY and GOOGLE_API_KEY are stored in a .env file or directly in your environment variables:
- GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
- GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key

**Start the Application**: Run the Streamlit application using streamlit run app.py

**Usage**:
- **Upload Documents**: Place your PDF documents in the us_census directory or adjust the path in the code to point to your own directory.
- **Embedding Documents**: Click the "Documents Embedding" button to create vector embeddings of your documents for search and retrieval.
- **Ask Questions**: Enter a question in the provided text input to retrieve an answer based on document content.

**Credits**:
This project is inspired by the work of **Krish Naik** who provided an insightful tutorial that helped in developing this Q&A application.
